# Quantpos Playground

This playground lets you try quantpos with different contexts.

When you click on "toggle", the `#c2` element will be placed at the exact location of the `#c` element, no matter the transformation, position, margin and padding.

Also, when you click in the `#areaB` (the cyan rect), the purple ball will get transformed to the click position.

Note that `#c2` and the `#ball` element are not related in the dom to their target, to demonstrate FLIP-like usage of quantpos.

# Usage

Clone this repository, run insall in your npm-like, then launch the `serve` script.
